# Problem Statement

So basically, most people have zero clue how much carbon they're actually producing. You drive to work, grab a burger, leave the AC running - but what does that even mean for the environment?

I wanted to build something that just shows you the numbers without making you feel bad about it.

## The idea

Track your daily stuff (commute, meals, electricity) and see actual CO2 numbers. Not vague percentages - real kg of carbon dioxide.

Plus theres an AI chatbot that looks at your data and gives tips that actually make sense for YOU. Like if you drive a lot, it won't tell you to "take public transport" if theres none in your area - itll suggest carpooling or WFH options.

## Tech stack

- Frontend: React + Vite
- Backend: Node/Express
- Database: Firebase Firestore
- Auth: Firebase Auth
- AI: Google Gemini API

## Features

1. Log activities by category (transport, food, energy, waste)
2. Dashboard with charts showing emissions over time
3. AI recommendations personalized to your usage
4. Chat assistant for questions

Thats pretty much it. Simple tracker with smart suggestions.
