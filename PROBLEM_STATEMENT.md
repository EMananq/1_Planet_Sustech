# Carbon Footprint Calculator - Problem Statement

## What's the Problem?

Most people have no idea how much carbon they produce daily. We drive to work, eat meat, use electricity - but how does that actually impact the environment? There's no easy way to track this stuff.

I wanted to build something that makes it simple to see your environmental impact without being preachy or complicated.

## My Solution

A web app where you can log your daily activities (driving, eating, energy use) and actually SEE the carbon footprint in real numbers. Not just "reduce your emissions" - actual kg of CO2.

### What it does:

- **Track activities** - Log your commute, meals, electricity usage
- **See the numbers** - Dashboard shows total emissions with charts
- **Get tips** - AI gives you personalized suggestions based on YOUR data
- **Chat with AI** - Ask questions about reducing your footprint

## Why I Built This

Climate change is real but most apps either guilt-trip you or are way too complicated. I wanted something that just shows you the facts and helps you make small changes.

The AI part is cool because it doesn't give generic advice - it looks at what YOU actually do and suggests realistic changes.

## Tech Used

- React frontend (Vite)
- Node.js/Express backend
- Firebase for auth & database
- Google Gemini AI for recommendations

## Who's It For?

Anyone who's curious about their carbon footprint but doesn't want to spend hours researching. Just log what you do, see the impact, get some tips.
